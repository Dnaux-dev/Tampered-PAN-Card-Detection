# Tampered-PAN-Card-Detection
Machine learning project

This project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the ID i.e the PAN card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone original or not.
The various stages of the machine learning process includes

1. Get Images from user
2. Check for the size and format of the image
3. Change the shape and size of the image according to the original image
4. Convert the image to GRAYSCALE
5. Find the Similarity index of the images
6. Finding the threshold of the Image
7. Find contours and Grab those contours using imutils
8. Draw a bounding rectangle using these contours
9. Plot difference, threshold, original, and tampered image
10.Compare all the images and check the similarity score to decide to tamper.

PAN is a ten-digit unique alphanumeric number issued by the Income Tax Department. PAN is issued in the form of a laminated plastic card as given below (commonly known as PAN card)
